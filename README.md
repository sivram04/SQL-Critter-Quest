# SQL Critter Quest

SQL Critter Quest is an interactive browser-based game designed to help learners practice SQL through small, progressive challenges. Players write SQL queries, receive instant feedback, earn points, and unlock new levels as they progress.

The project runs entirely in the browser using an in-memory SQLite database powered by SQL.js.
